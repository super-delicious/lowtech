    <p class="myP"><strong>About this website</strong> - The aim is to reduce energy usage by using minimal web design. To reduce energy consumption substantially below that of a typical website, use default fonts and static graphics. I also include URL to the original works' websites, which are high-tech websites built with three.js, so you can choose to view the works on this low-tech sites or the high-tech sites.  </p>

    <p class="myP"><strong>About me</strong> - Hello, I am Yixin Cao, a digital media artist. I believe the artists should start working low technology website to consider the ecological impact. Considering that renewable energy is not always available and the Internet is dependent on fossil fuels, the growth in data traffic has outpaced advances in energy efficiency. As artists, we should consider work on a low-tech web design to decrease the average page size. We should build a static website that has less processing power and thus less energy usage. </p>
