	<p class="myH1">Social Distance Shelter</h1>
    <p class="myP">Maya 3D Modeling & Rendering, 2020</p>
    <p class="myP">	My inspiration originates from the fact that the epidemic is a contagious disease that requires people to keep a social distance. This motivates me to create a virtual space as the scenery of spiritual healing for security purposes. It is
      also the revelation of the reality of environmental degradation. I constructed a shelter to keep individuals in a comfortable and safe environment, reducing their exposure to dangerous outside conditions. </p>
